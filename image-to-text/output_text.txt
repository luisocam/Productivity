Financial risk management

The company’s operations expose it to a variety of financial risks that include the effects of changes in credit risk, liquidity risk
and interest rate risk. The company has in place a risk management programme that seeks to limit the adverse effects on the
financial performance of the company where appropriate. The company is funded internally by the INEOS group and therefore
has no direct exposure to liquidity or debt market risk. Interest rate exposures are managed on a group basis.

Going concern “

As at 31 December 2018 the Company has net current liabilities of £204,000; however the directors believe that preparing the
financial statements on the going concern basis is appropriate due to the continued financial support of INEOS Industries
Limited. The directors have received confirmation that INEOS Industries Limited intend to support the company for at least one
year after these financial statements are signed.
